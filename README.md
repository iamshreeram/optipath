# optipath
Optipath is a route optimization app that calculates the optimum path and generates the best possible route for traversing from a given list of coordinates or places. It calculates the most efficient path, ensuring that every destination is visited only once and with the shortest distance traveled.


# Steps 
1. Obtain the list of destinations from the user where they plan to visit.
2. Determine the coordinates of each location using relevant factors and information (Using Geocoding API)
3. Download the required map data and routing data for the specified regions (If only for Oklahoma and Texas or something specific), from Google Maps or Mapbox or Organic Maps to optimize the process.
4. Utilize a route optimization tool, specifically utilizing Genetic Algorithm or other optimization algorithm specifically tailored, to generate the most efficient path that visits each location only once.
5. Allow users to adjust parameters such as travel mode (driving, walking, cycling) or time constraints to customize the optimization process.
6. Present the optimized route in the user interface for easy viewing and navigation (including turn-by-turn directions and estimated travel times for each stop).
7. Incorporate real-time traffic data or historical traffic patterns to dynamically adjust the route for the most efficient travel. (Future)
